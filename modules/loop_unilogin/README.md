# Loop UNI•Login

This module enables UNI•Login on a Loop site. After succesful login,
some user data will be fetched from the UNI•Login web service and
updated on the user (if not already set)

## Post-installation configuration

Users must be created automatically after signing in through UNI•Login. To
enable this, go to `/admin/config/people/accounts > Registration and
cancellation > Who can register accounts?` and check "Visitors".
